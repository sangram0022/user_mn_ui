# ADR-0001: Adopt Domain-Driven Design Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - October 2025

## Context

The application was growing in complexity with tightly coupled components, business logic scattered across the codebase, and difficulty in testing and maintaining features. We needed a structured approach to organize code that:

1. Clearly separates concerns
2. Makes business logic explicit and testable
3. Scales with team size and feature complexity
4. Improves code discoverability and maintainability
5. Enforces clear boundaries between layers

## Decision

We will adopt **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture with the following structure:

```
src/
├── domains/           # Business domains (bounded contexts)
│   ├── authentication/
│   ├── users/
│   └── workflows/
├── infrastructure/    # Technical infrastructure
│   ├── api/
│   ├── storage/
│   └── security/
├── shared/            # Shared utilities and types
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── utils/
└── test/              # Test infrastructure
```

### Key Principles

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic, entities, and domain services
2. **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical concerns (API calls, storage, security)
3. **Shared Layer**: Reusable utilities that don't belong to specific domains
4. **Dependency Rule**: Domains can use infrastructure, but infrastructure cannot depend on domains

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ **Clear Boundaries**: Each domain has clear boundaries and responsibilities
- ✅ **Testability**: Business logic is isolated and easy to test
- ✅ **Scalability**: New features can be added as new domains without affecting existing code
- ✅ **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different domains independently
- ✅ **Discoverability**: New team members can quickly find relevant code
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific domains
- ✅ **Ubiquitous Language**: Domain structure reflects business language

### Negative

- ❌ **Initial Overhead**: More setup and boilerplate compared to flat structure
- ❌ **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand DDD principles
- ❌ **Potential Over-Engineering**: For very simple features, full DDD might be overkill
- ❌ **Refactoring Effort**: Migrating existing code requires significant refactoring

### Neutral

- ⚪ **More Files**: Increased number of files and directories
- ⚪ **Import Paths**: Longer import paths (mitigated by path aliases)

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Feature-Based Structure
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── users/
│   └── dashboard/
```
**Why not chosen**: Less explicit about technical vs business concerns, harder to enforce separation.

### 2. Layer-Based Structure
```
src/
├── components/
├── services/
├── utils/
└── hooks/
```
**Why not chosen**: Doesn't scale well, hard to find related code, business logic gets scattered.

### 3. Atomic Design
```
src/
├── atoms/
├── molecules/
├── organisms/
├── templates/
└── pages/
```
**Why not chosen**: Primarily focuses on UI components, doesn't address business logic organization.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Domain Structure
Each domain should follow this structure:
```
domains/[domain-name]/
├── components/       # Domain-specific UI components
├── hooks/           # Domain-specific React hooks
├── store/           # Domain state management (Zustand)
├── services/        # Domain business logic
├── types/           # Domain TypeScript types
└── index.ts         # Public API exports
```

### Naming Conventions
- Use **singular** for domain names (`user` not `users`)
- Use **PascalCase** for components and classes
- Use **camelCase** for functions and variables
- Use **kebab-case** for file names

### Dependency Management
- Infrastructure → Shared (allowed)
- Domain → Infrastructure (allowed)
- Domain → Shared (allowed)
- Domain → Domain (discouraged, use events/mediator)
- Infrastructure → Domain (forbidden)
- Shared → Domain (forbidden)
