# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant architectural decisions made in this project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Why ADRs?

- **Documentation**: Provides clear documentation of why decisions were made
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Helps new team members understand the reasoning behind choices
- **Historical Context**: Preserves the context that led to decisions
- **Accountability**: Makes decision-making transparent and traceable

## ADR Format

Each ADR should follow this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]

### Positive
- [List positive consequences]

### Negative
- [List negative consequences or trade-offs]

### Neutral
- [List neutral impacts]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options were considered and why were they not chosen?]

## References
- [Links to relevant documentation, discussions, or resources]
```

## Naming Convention

ADRs should be named following this pattern:
```
ADR-XXXX-short-title.md
```

Where:
- `XXXX` is a 4-digit sequential number (e.g., 0001, 0002)
- `short-title` is a brief, kebab-case description

Examples:
- `ADR-0001-adopt-zustand-for-state-management.md`
- `ADR-0002-implement-ddd-architecture.md`
- `ADR-0003-use-vite-instead-of-webpack.md`

## Process

1. **Create**: When facing a significant architectural decision, create a new ADR in "Proposed" status
2. **Discuss**: Share with the team for review and feedback
3. **Decide**: After consensus, update status to "Accepted"
4. **Implement**: Implement the decision
5. **Review**: Periodically review ADRs to ensure they're still relevant

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-0001: Adopt DDD Architecture](./ADR-0001-adopt-ddd-architecture.md)
- [ADR-0002: Zustand for State Management](./ADR-0002-zustand-state-management.md)
- [ADR-0003: Security Headers and CSP](./ADR-0003-security-headers-csp.md)
