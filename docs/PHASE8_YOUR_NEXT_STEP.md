- Complete remaining tests post-launch
- Good risk/reward balance
- Real-world testing environment

### 📋 What You'll Do:
**Phase 1 - Critical QA (1.5 hours)**:
1. Test Module 1: Authentication (30 min)
2. Test Module 2: User Management (1 hour)
3. Verify core functionality works

**Phase 2 - Deploy (30 min)**:
4. Deploy to production
5. Run smoke tests
6. Verify deployment successful

- **Critical QA**: 1.5 hours
- **Deploy**: 30 min
- **Full QA**: 4 hours (post-launch)

**Total**: 6 hours spread across deployment

### 🎬 **Start Now**:
```powershell
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Open critical test procedures
# File: docs/MANUAL_TESTING_PROCEDURES.md
# Focus on: Module 1 (Auth) and Module 2 (User Management)

# 3. After critical tests pass, say "ready to deploy"
```
