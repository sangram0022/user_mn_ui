## ✅ How to Execute a Test

### For Each Test Case:

1. **Read the procedure** in MANUAL_TESTING_PROCEDURES.md

## 🔴 What to Do When Tests Fail

### For Each Failure:

1. **Don't panic** - Issues are expected and normal
2. **Try to reproduce** - Run the test 2-3 more times
   - If it fails consistently: It's a real bug
   - If it fails sometimes: It's a flaky test
3. **Document the failure** in QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md:
   ```
   Issue Title: [What's wrong]
   Severity: [Critical/Major/Minor]
   Steps to Reproduce: [How to make it happen again]
   Expected: [What should happen]
   Actual: [What actually happens]
