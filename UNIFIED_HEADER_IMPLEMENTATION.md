# Unified Header Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Created a single, reusable Header component that works across the entire application with dynamic navigation based on user authentication state and role.

## Problem Solved

- ❌ **Before**: Multiple redundant headers (HomePage had its own, AuthLayout needed one, AppLayout had PrimaryNavigation)
- ❌ **Before**: No header on auth pages (login/register)
- ❌ **Before**: Inconsistent navigation experience
- ✅ **After**: One unified Header component used everywhere
- ✅ **After**: Role-based navigation dynamically shows/hides links
- ✅ **After**: Consistent user experience across all pages

## Implementation

### 1. Created Unified Header Component

**File**: `src/components/common/Header.tsx`

**Features**:

- ✅ **Logo**: Always visible, links to homepage
- ✅ **Guest Navigation**: Sign In + Get Started buttons when not authenticated
- ✅ **Authenticated Navigation**: Dashboard, Profile, Users (admin only)
- ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Shows different links based on user role
  - Regular users: Dashboard, Profile
  - Admin users: Dashboard, Users, Analytics, Profile
- ✅ **User Menu Dropdown**: Profile, Settings, Sign Out
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Hamburger menu for mobile devices
- ✅ **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, escape key support

### 2. Updated All Layouts

#### HomePage (`src/domains/home/pages/HomePage.tsx`)

- ✅ Removed inline header code
- ✅ Now uses unified Header component
- ✅ Maintains all sections: Hero, Features, CTA, Footer

#### AuthLayout (`src/layouts/AuthLayout.tsx`)

- ✅ Added unified Header component
- ✅ No longer headerless
- ✅ Consistent with rest of application

#### AppLayout

- ✅ Can optionally use unified Header instead of PrimaryNavigation
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality

### 3. Role-Based Navigation Logic

```typescript
// Navigation items based on user role
const getNavItems = () => {
  if (!user) return [];

  const baseItems = [
    { name: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard' },
    { name: 'Profile', href: '/profile' },
  ];

  // Add admin-specific items
  if (user.is_superuser || user.role === 'admin' || user.role_name === 'admin') {
    baseItems.splice(1, 0, { name: 'Users', href: '/users' });
    baseItems.splice(2, 0, { name: 'Analytics', href: '/analytics' });
  }

  return baseItems;
};
```

                                                          ├─ Analytics (admin)
                                                          ├─ Profile
