## 🎯 Three Optimization Paths for Week 2

### Path A: Virtual Scrolling (VISIBLE IMPACT)
```
Impact:   20x faster for large tables
Time:     45 minutes
Why:      Users see immediate improvement
Result:   Dashboard table: 5s → instant
```

### Path B: Request Deduplication (QUICK WIN)
```
Impact:   50% fewer API calls
Time:     30 minutes
Why:      Configuration only, no coding
Result:   API calls: 40 → 20
```

### Path C: Service Worker (UX GAME-CHANGER)
```
Impact:   90% faster repeat visits + offline
Time:     45 minutes
Why:      Biggest perceived improvement
Result:   Repeat visits: 5s → 0.5s (10x faster!)
```
