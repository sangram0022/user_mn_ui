## 3. Logging Strategy

### Client-Side Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging with consistent format
- **Log Levels**: Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Context Enrichment**: Add user context, session info, and environment data
- **Performance Impact**: Minimize logging performance impact



### Analytics
- **Google Analytics 4**: Web analytics and user behavior tracking
- **Mixpanel**: Product analytics and user segmentation

- Implement advanced analytics
- Continuous monitoring improvements

## 9. Cost Considerations

### Tool Selection
- **Free Tiers**: Utilize free tiers of monitoring tools
- **Scalable Pricing**: Choose tools with predictable scaling costs
- **Open Source Options**: Consider open-source alternatives where possible

### Data Management
- **Data Sampling**: Implement data sampling for high-volume events
- **Retention Policies**: Define cost-effective data retention
- **Archiving**: Implement data archiving strategies

## 10. Best Practices

### Monitoring Best Practices
- **Define SLOs/SLIs**: Service Level Objectives and Indicators
- **Monitor Business Metrics**: Don't just monitor technical metrics
- **Alert on Symptoms**: Alert on user impact, not just technical issues
- **Automate Remediation**: Implement automated fixes where possible

### Analytics Best Practices
- **User-Centric Metrics**: Focus on user experience and business value
