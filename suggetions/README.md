## Implementation Priority

### üî• High Priority (Immediate - 1-2 weeks)
1. Update README.md and project documentation
2. Enable type-aware ESLint rules
3. Implement error boundaries
4. Remove legacy code (`apiClientLegacy.ts`, `adapters/`)
5. Set up pre-commit hooks

### üü° Medium Priority (Short-term - 2-4 weeks)
1. Begin project restructure (Phase 1-2)
2. Increase test coverage to meet thresholds
3. Implement lazy loading and code splitting
4. Add input validation and sanitization
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### üü¢ Low Priority (Medium-term - 1-3 months)
1. Complete project restructure
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring
3. Add internationalization (i18n)
4. Advanced performance optimizations
5. Full accessibility audit

## Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)
- Update README.md with project-specific information
- Enable strict TypeScript mode
- Add error boundaries around route components
- Remove duplicate component files
- Set up basic pre-commit hooks

## Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and TypeScript errors reduced to zero
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve 80%+ coverage across all categories
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals within acceptable ranges
- **Security**: Pass basic security audits
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Developer Experience**: Faster build times and better DX

## Getting Started
1. Review each suggestion file based on your priorities
2. Create implementation tasks in your project management tool
3. Start with high-priority items
4. Track progress and measure improvements
5. Reassess priorities based on project needs

## Contributing to Suggestions
- Each file focuses on a specific area for better organization
- Suggestions are prioritized by impact and effort
- Implementation details include specific code examples where helpful
- Regular updates based on new best practices and project evolution
