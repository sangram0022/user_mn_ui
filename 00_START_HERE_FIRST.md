## 💡 Pro Tips

### Before Starting Week 2:
```bash
# Verify Week 1 is solid
npm run build 2>&1 | Select-String "error"
# Should return nothing (0 errors)

# Check bundle size
npm run build 2>&1 | Select-String "gzip"
# Should show ~122 kB (stable)
```

### While Implementing:
```bash
# After each phase, build
npm run build

# Check no new errors
npm run build 2>&1 | Select-String "error"

# Commit progress
git add -A
git commit -m "Week 2: Virtual scrolling complete"
```

### After All Optimizations:
```bash
# Final build
npm run build

# Should still be ~122 kB (PWA adds ~3 kB)
npm run build 2>&1 | Select-String "gzip"

# Test locally
npm run dev

# Run Lighthouse (Ctrl+Shift+I)
# Should score 95+
```
