## General Guidelines

- Write code in a clean, maintainable, and efficient manner.
- use react and typescript best practices.
  use react 19 features at all possible places, and replace old patterns with new ones.
- no missing import should be there
- i am going to deploy this app on AWS, so dont implement features that aws already support, like resource utilization, observability, any any other, which is by default available in asw, keep code clean
